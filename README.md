# streamlit-spam-mail-classifier
This is the 'Classification of Textual E-Mail Spam Using Na√Øve Bayes Classifier' integrated in Streamlit Application.
<br>
I have used Streamlit framework for integration because it lets us turn data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes. We can instantly develop web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science and deploy them easily using Streamlit.
<br><br>
<strong>Installing Streamlit</strong>
 1. Make sure you have python installed in your system

 2. Use the following command to install streamlit,

  <code> pip install streamlit </code>
<br><br>
<strong>Running a streamlit app</strong>
<br>
   First, you need create a python script with streamlit commands and execute the script using the following command,

   <code>streamlit run <yourscript.py> </code>
 <br><br>
  Below is the simple UI of the E-mail classifier project where user enters the message in the text box and the Machine Learning Model predicts and display the result as 'Spam/Ham' when user clicks the 'Predict' button.
